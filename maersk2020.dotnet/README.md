# [Marsk 2020 Challenge](Challenge.md), ASP.NET Core App
October 2020.

## Requirements
To be able to build and run the application, you need:

- [Microsoft .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.1.
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (whatever flavor, latest version).
- An operating system targeted by the .NET Core: WIndows, MacOS or Linux.

To interact with the web API, you will need either:

- An HTTP client (fx. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler), etc.).
- The [WebIntSorter ReactClient](WebIntSorter/WebIntSorter.ReactClient/README.md).

## Get
To get the application, you can either:

- [Clone the Challenges repository](https://github.com/andry-tino/coding-challenges.git).
- Use the binaries already available as [releases](https://github.com/andry-tino/coding-challenges/releases). It is recommended to pick up the latest version among those available.

## Build
If you already got the binaries, you can skip this.
You can either:

- Build the server using Visual Studio.
- Build the server using the commandline.

### Building the server in Visual Studio
To build the server using Visual Studio:

1. Open the solution `WebIntSorter.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Select configuration `Release`.
3. Build the solution by selecting: `Build`, `Build Solution` in Visual Studio.

### Building the server using `dotnet`
To build the server using the commandline:

1. Open a new shell window.
2. Navigate to `maersk2020.dotnet/WebIntSorter/WebIntSorter`.
3. Run command: `dotnet publish -c Release`.

## Running the server
To run the server you can either:

- Use Visual Studio to run the application (after building it, see previous steps).
- Use the binaries already available.

By default, the server will run on port `5000` for HTTP (only in `Development` environment) and port `5001` for HTTPS (recommended).

### Running in Visual Studio
If you chose to build the solution, after doing so, do the following:

1. Select the `WebIntSorterProd` configuration.
    - Use the `WebIntSorter` configuration to get the `Development` environment and be able to use HTTP.
2. Select the `Run` button.

### Running using `dotnet`
If you want to use the commandline and you built the code using `dotnet`:

1. Navigate to `maersk2020.dotnet/WebIntSorter/WebIntSorter`.
2. Run command: `dotnet run --configuration Release --launch-profile WebIntSorterProd`.
    - Use option `--launch-profile WebIntSorter` to get the `Development` environment and be able to use HTTP.

### Running the binaries
If you got the binaries, no build was required. Do the following:

1. In the folder you got, open a new shell.
2. Set environment variable `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` to `"Production"`.
3. Run: `dotnet .\Maersk2020DotNet.WebIntSorter.dll`.

## Using WebIntSorter
WIS is a server exposing a web API to sort integer sequences.

- Two routes are available: `/api`, `/api/sorting`.
- Allowed verbs  (HTTP methods) for `/api` are:
	- `GET`: Get info on the API.
- Allowed verbs  (HTTP methods) for `/api/sorting` are:
    - `POST`: Enqueue a sorting job.
	- `GET`: Get info about all the enqueued jobs or one specific job.
- `Content-Type`: `application/json`.

Submit a `GET` request against `/api` to get a list of all supported routes in the API. Use `/api/sorting` to access sorting functionalities.

### Enqueueing a sorting job
To enqueue a sorting job, submit a `POST` request to `/api/sorting` by specifying the sequence to sort inside an array of integers:

```
POST /api/sorting HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5001
Content-Type: application/json

[1,5,3,7,3,45,4,67,53,0]
```

The response will be sent immediately:

```
{
    "id": "6e0b0385-2bbe-447b-a7e3-aa2bd5cec1af"
}
```

It will contain the ID of the job just enqueued.

### Retrieving jobs info
To retrieve the list of enqueued jobs and their info, submit a `GET` request to `/api/sorting`:

```
GET /api/sorting/ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5001
Content-Type: application/json
```

The response:

```
[
	{
		"id": "6e0b0385-2bbe-447b-a7e3-aa2bd5cec1af",
		"timestamp": "2020-10-04T17:07:39.1873311+02:00",
		"duration": 150,
		"status": 1,
		"values": [...],
		"originalValues": [...]
	},
	...
]
```

It will include an array of object, each representing a job:

```
{
	"id": string,
	"timestamp": string,
	"duration": number,
	"status": number,
	"values": number[],
	"originalValues": number[]
}
```

- `id`: The unique identifier of the job.
- `timestamp`: The date and time when the job was enqueued.
- `duration`: The time, in milliseconds, elapsed from the moment the job was enqueued, until the sorting has been completed.
- `status`: The status of the job.
    - `0`: Pending, the job is still running.
	- `1`: Completed successfully.
	- `2`: Failed.
- `values`: The sorted sequence if the status is `1`. The value will be `null` is status is `0`. The value should not be relied upon if status is `2`.
- `originalValues`: The original sequence provided when the job was enqueued.

If no jobs have been enqueued, the response body will be an empty aray `[]`.

### Retrieving one specific job
To retrieve one specific job, submit a `GET` request to `/api/sorting/{job-id}`, where
`{job-id}` is the ID of the job enqueued previously:

```
GET /api/sorting/6e0b0385-2bbe-447b-a7e3-aa2bd5cec1af HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:5001
Content-Type: application/json
```

The response:

```
{
	"id": "6e0b0385-2bbe-447b-a7e3-aa2bd5cec1af",
	"timestamp": "2020-10-04T17:07:39.1873311+02:00",
	"duration": 150,
	"status": 1,
	"values": [...],
	"originalValues": [...]
}
```

It will include only one object representing the requested job.

If the requested job (the job ID) does not exist, the response body will be empty and the response status will be `204 No Content`.

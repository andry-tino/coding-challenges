# [Marsk 2020 Challenge](Challenge.md), ASP.NET Core App
October 2020.

## Requirements
To be able to build and run the application, you need:

- [Microsoft .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.1.
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (whatever flavor, latest version).
- An operating system targeted by the .NET Core: WIndows, MacOS or Linux.

To interact with the web API, you will need either:

- An HTTP client (fx. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler), etc.).
- The [WebIntSorter ReactClient](WebIntSorter/WebIntSorter.ReactClient/README.md).

## Building the server
To build the server:

1. Open the solution `WebIntSorter.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution by selecting: `Build`, `Build Solution` in Visual Studio.

## Running the server
To run the server you can either:

- Use Visual Studio to build the solution and then run the application.
- Use the binaries already available as [releases](https://github.com/andry-tino/coding-challenges/releases). It is recommended to pick up the latest version among those available.

### Running in Visual Studio
If you choose to build on your own the solution, after doing so, do the following:

1. Select the `WebIntSorter` configuration.
2. Select the `Run` button.

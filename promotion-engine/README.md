# [Challenge](Challenge.md), .NET Core library + ASP.NET Core Api
October 2020.

## Requirements
To be able to build the li8brary and build and run the application, you need:

- [Microsoft .NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) 3.1.
- [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (whatever flavor, latest version).
- An operating system targeted by the .NET Core: WIndows, MacOS or Linux.

To interact with the web API, you will need either:

- An HTTP client (fx. [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler), etc.).

## Get
To get the application, you can:

- [Clone the Challenges repository](https://github.com/andry-tino/coding-challenges.git).

## Build
Two solutions have been set up:

- `PromoEngLibrary.sln`: library only.
- `PromoEng.sln`: library + example app (web API).

You have these options:
- If you want to build the library and run its tests, open `PromoEngLibrary.sln` in Visual Studio, build and run tests.
- If you want to test the library using the example web API, open `PromoEng.sln` in Visual Studio, build and run tests. To run the web app, choose the `PromoEng.CoreWebApi` as run configuration (after selecting the `PromoEng.CoreWebApi` project) and run it.

By default, the server will run on port `5000` for HTTP (only in `Development` environment) and port `5001` for HTTPS (recommended).

The web app will start with configuration `appsettings.json`. In there, you can find the default sequence of rules being set and the SKU collection. You can change it and restart the app to use a different sequence of rules and a different set of SKU.

## The library
The library consists of the following key components:

- `ICart`: An interface describing the general behavior of a cart:
    - Storing SKUs.
    - Merging with another cart.
    - Providing info on the collection.
    - Adding SKUs to the collection.
- `Sku`: A type representing a single SKU for exclusive identification purposes.
- `IPromotionRule`: Interface describing the general behavior of a promotion rule. Promotion rules are thought as atomic and having no side effects on carts. They take a cart as input and, without changing it, return a different cart. Promotion rules are mutually exclusive: one SKU in cart can be processed by one rule only.
- `IPromotionPipeline`: An interface describing the general behavior of a `promotion pipeline`, that is: a sequential application of promotion rules in a specific order. Pipelines require rules to be added. When applied to a cart, a new cart is returned as a result of the application of all the rules, in order.

Design goals:

1. **Immutability of carts with respect to rules:** Considering the library has application in scenarios involving money and the purchase and selling of goods, design has been optimized for transactional scenarios. Rules treat carts as immutable objects. This adds a cost in terms of GC pressure.
2. **Complexity:** Rules execute with linear complexity with respect to the number of items in the cart.

## The web API
The web server exposes the following endpoints:

- `/api`: Information about the API.
- `/api/cart`: Interact with the application to create and manage carts.

## Cart handling API
The following functionalities are available:

- `GET /api/cart`: Get all carts (only info).
- `GET /api/cart/<id>`: Get a specific cart (info + content).
- `POST /api/cart`: Create a new cart.
- `POST /api/cart/<id>`: Checkout cart.
- `PUT /api/cart/<id>`: Add SKU to cart.
- `DELETE /api/cart/<id>`: Delete (not checked out) cart.

Swagger is available at `/api` to get more info.
